## Intro to my project

---

This is a computer part management system. 

---

## Expain the features and database schema

This site handles data of customers, users, products, and orders, so users can manage their customers and products.

The CRUD system is for customers, users, and orders. 

I downloaded breeze to make login menu, so I handle user's table by using it.

## Demo

- Users can add customers information.
<img src="/public/img/AddCustomer.jpg" alt="AddCustomer">

- Now, I added Test User and I am going to edit and delete it.
<img src="/public/img/AddedCustomer.jpg" alt="AddedCustomer">

- Now, the customer's name is Laravel
<img src="/public/img/UpdatedCustomer.jpg" alt="UpdatedCustomer">
<img src="/public/img/updateScreen.jpg" alt="UpdatedScreen">

- I clicked the delete button and it has gone.
<img src="/public/img/DeletedCustomer.jpg" alt="DeletedCustomer">

-  When I click the dashboard on the menu, we have dashboard.
<img src="/public/img/dashboard.jpg" alt="dashboard">

- If you were unable to complete the assignment, explain what you wanted to do and why you couldn't complete it.
  
When I try add orders and update orders, 403 error comes up. I  would like to practice laravel more and be used to using it.

- Your thoughts on Laravel and if you wanted to cover anything else in the class to supplement your learnings.
  
For now, it is easier for me to use php, but I believe laravel is more useful when I get used to it because I could create login page more easily than php.

I also did not have to write SQL query, so Laravel would be useful tool.

I would like to learn more about security and how we can prevent from syber attacks.
